# Jam Together
Jam Together is an interactive sound installation designed for Roskilde Festival. It allows festival attendees to explore their creativity and connect with others through playful sound exploration.

The installation features a control panel with various input types, including buttons and distance sensors, to encourage exploration and experimentation. These inputs will trigger different sound samples and filter effects through Ableton Live running on a computer housed in a waterproof box. The installation also uses synchronized lights that react to the music. The music and samples are made by the group, meaning no copyright infringements.

To ensure a focused and immersive experience, the installation will be equipped with sound-directing buckets positioned above the user. This design keeps the sound contained and prevents disruption to other festival-goers.

The primary goal of Jam Together is to explore how people interact with sound, particularly in a collaborative setting, and how music acts as a catalyst for social interaction.
